1. Barometric Sensor (Based on Air Pressure)
Potential Errors:

Temperature Variations: Changes in air temperature can cause incorrect pressure-to-height conversions.
Weather Conditions: Variations in atmospheric pressure due to storms or other weather systems can lead to errors.
Altitude Setting (QNH/QFE): Incorrect settings on the altimeter may result in height errors relative to sea level or ground.
Calibration Drift: Over time, sensors may drift, leading to inaccuracies.
Example:

A barometric altimeter on a helicopter shows an error of ±30 feet when flying through a storm due to abrupt pressure changes.
2. LIDAR (Using Laser Measurements)
Potential Errors:

Reflectivity of the Surface: Highly reflective or non-reflective surfaces (e.g., water, snow) can lead to inaccurate distance measurements.
Dust or Fog: Atmospheric particulates scatter the laser, causing errors or signal loss.
Multipath Interference: Reflected laser signals from surrounding objects may cause inaccurate readings.
Signal Saturation: Very close or highly reflective surfaces might overload the sensor.
Example:

A LIDAR sensor on an airplane flying over a dense forest may misinterpret tree canopies as ground level due to surface reflectivity variations.
3. Radio Sensor (Using Radio Waves)
Potential Errors:

Multipath Propagation: Radio waves may bounce off surrounding structures or terrain, leading to incorrect readings.
Signal Attenuation: Rain, snow, or fog can weaken the signal, causing errors in height detection.
Surface Type: Absorptive surfaces like water or uneven terrain might not reflect signals accurately.
Frequency Drift: Changes in frequency due to hardware imperfections or environmental factors can affect accuracy.
Example:

A radar altimeter on a helicopter flying over rough terrain may show an altitude error of ±10 feet due to multipath effects from nearby rocks.
General Considerations:
Combined Sensor Systems: Many modern aircraft use multiple types of sensors to compensate for individual errors. For example, barometric sensors are complemented by radar altimeters for low-altitude operations.
Environmental Adaptations: Some sensors have built-in algorithms to filter noise caused by environmental conditions.
